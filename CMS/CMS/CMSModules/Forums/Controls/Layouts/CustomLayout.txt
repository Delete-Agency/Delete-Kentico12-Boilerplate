To create a custom layout, you need to create a sub-folder inside this folder (same level as Flat + Tree layouts are).
The name of this sub-folder will be used as the name of the layout. 
The sub-folder has to contain controls with the same names as included in the Flat or Tree folders.
Add this layout name (folder name) into the form control Forum layout selector (Options property).
